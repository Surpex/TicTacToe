# TicTacToe
This is a simple tic tac toe game that I built to practice Java Swing. There's no "play against cpu", it's a simple turn by turn game where the first move is an X, the next is an O, the next an X and so on. When the game has been won or when a draw has been encountered, the game will end and display the user with a button to restart the game.
